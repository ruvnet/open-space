# Implementation Details for GitHub Copilot Workspace Clone

## Initial Implementation

The GitHub Copilot Workspace clone has been fully implemented according to the specifications provided in the README.md. This document outlines the steps taken for the initial setup, the structure of the code, and instructions for installation.

### Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ruvnet/open-space.git
   cd open-space
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables as described in the README.md.

4. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/install.sh
   ./scripts/install.sh
   ```

### Code Structure

The project is structured as outlined in the README.md, with directories for components, pages, styles, and server configurations. Here's a brief overview:

- `components/`: Contains UI components like Sidebar, TaskList, PlanEditor, CodeEditor, and Terminal.
- `pages/`: Contains pages for tasks, plans, editor, terminal, and settings, along with API routes for AI suggestions and authentication.
- `prisma/`: Contains the Prisma schema for database management.
- `styles/`: Contains CSS modules for styling the components.
- `server.js`: Sets up the server and WebSocket for real-time collaboration.

## Additional Notes

- WebSocket integration enables real-time collaboration in the code editor and terminal.
- Authentication is handled using NextAuth.js, with GitHub OAuth for login.
- The AI suggestion feature utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 engine to generate code suggestions.

This implementation provides a robust foundation for a collaborative coding environment, mimicking the functionality of GitHub Copilot Workspace.
